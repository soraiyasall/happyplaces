Product Amendments
------------------
The Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) field was populated in the December 2014 release of Points of Interest. More information can be found on page 19 in the User Guide.

DfT Parking is no longer a restricted provenance. Ordnance Survey has had to keep with the same file naming convention for the time being, until they can put out a request for 
change notice to their customers.
