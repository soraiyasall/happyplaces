Exploring how the built environment can improve social isolation. This project was carried out for my masters dissertation in partnership with the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham. 


Social isolation affects a wide range of people and can be defined as an absence of meaningful relationships. There is a lack of consensus on its measurability, however this study pools together variables found in previous research to create an index using Principal Component Analysis based on census data. It aims to understand how social isolation is distributed on a spatial scale quantifying it on a neighbourhood level. It focuses on Barking and Dagenham, a borough situated in East London. Many scholars have found a correlation between social isolation and the built environment. The built environment can be characterized as any human-made space. For the purpose of this research, points of interest are targeted as a measure of urban form -- locations that  are deemed useful and interesting for people. Two regression models are tested -- Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest regression -- to understand their relationship.
